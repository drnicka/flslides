  <h2>SBV for Public Goods Funding</h2>
  <p>Traditional public goods funding often rewards visibility rather than systemic importance, missing critical but less visible contributors.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Popularity Contest Problem:</strong> Projects with hype overshadow vital but underappreciated work.</li>
    <li><strong>Correlation & Information Cascades:</strong> Common information sources lead to redundant funding concentration on “obvious” choices.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Why Aligned Capital Matters</h2>
  <p>Aligned capital means funding that is directed to projects based on their systemic, long-term value, rather than just short-term popularity.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sustainable growth hinges on recognizing infrastructure and maintenance teams.</li>
    <li>SBV aims to surface these critical pathways of value.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>SBV and Quadratic Voting</h2>
  <p>SBV applies a quadratic cost to votes, forcing participants to carefully distribute their voting credits:</p>
  <p>\( \text{Cost}(v) = v^2 \)</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Concentrating 9 votes costs \(81\) credits, limiting overemphasis on a single tag.</li>
    <li>Encourages diversifying support across multiple semantic tags.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Semantic Tags as Decision Primitives</h2>
  <p>Instead of funding specific projects directly, voters support thematic axes (semantic tags) representing key priorities:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>#DeveloperTools</li>
    <li>#SecurityAudits</li>
    <li>#ProtocolUpgrade</li>
    <li>#UserEducation</li>
    <li>#Infrastructure</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These axes allow a richer expression of what truly matters in the ecosystem.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Building a Preference-Weighted Graph</h2>
  <p>Votes form a weighted graph where nodes are tags and edges represent co-preferences:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Edges weighted by the product of votes assigned by each participant to pairs of tags.</li>
    <li>Normalizing by participants’ budgets ensures fairness.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Identifying Systemic Priorities</h2>
  <p>From the preference-weighted graph, we can measure centrality to find systemic tags:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Central tags act as bridges between multiple thematic priorities.</li>
    <li>For example, #DeveloperTools might connect #SecurityAudits and #ProtocolUpgrade, indicating its critical role.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Thematic Clustering and Emergent Consensus</h2>
  <p>Clustering algorithms detect communities of semantically related tags:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reveals emergent focus areas (e.g., a cluster linking #UserEducation, #Infrastructure).</li>
    <li>Uncovers hidden common ground beyond raw popularity metrics.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Qualitative Context Integration</h2>
  <p>NLP analysis of participant feedback provides qualitative depth:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Extracted keywords illuminate why participants value certain tags.</li>
    <li>Sentiment analysis uncovers enthusiasm or frustration, ensuring richer context.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Reducing Correlation and Information Cascades</h2>
  <p>Quadratic voting and semantic analysis mitigate herd behavior:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Voters can’t just follow the crowd without cost.</li>
    <li>The graph’s structure highlights overlooked but essential domains.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Outcome: Aligned Capital Flows</h2>
  <p>With SBV, funding decisions reflect systemic value, not just popularity:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Crucial but less visible projects receive support.</li>
    <li>Long-term ecosystem health is prioritized over short-term gains.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Ethereum Case Study</h2>
  <p>Consider a funding round in Ethereum:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>#DeveloperTools might not be top-of-mind but bridges multiple priority axes.</li>
    <li>SBV identifies #DeveloperTools as systemically central, channeling capital accordingly.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>From Popularity Contests to Systemic Value</h2>
  <p>SBV shifts the governance paradigm:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Decisions informed by holistic, multi-dimensional data.</li>
    <li>Underappreciated contributors are recognized for their systemic importance.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Conclusion: A More Resilient Public Goods Ecosystem</h2>
  <p>Semantic Ballot Voting ensures fair, effective, and future-aligned public goods funding by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Diversifying preferences and mitigating correlation.</li>
    <li>Surfacing hidden value through semantic graphs.</li>
    <li>Incorporating qualitative context for richer understanding.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>SBV directs aligned capital to where it creates sustainable impact.</p>

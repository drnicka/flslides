  <h1>What is Semantic Ballot Voting?</h1>
  <p>A new paradigm for capturing nuanced community preferences and thematic connections between issues.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>SBV at a Glance</h2>
  <p>Semantic Ballot Voting (SBV) goes beyond simple majority votes, capturing nuanced preferences and thematic relationships between issues.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Voters allocate votes across multiple semantic tags, not just one option.</li>
    <li>Issues become interconnected nodes within a larger semantic network.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Why Move Beyond Traditional Voting?</h2>
  <p>Typical voting methods flatten complex priorities into a single choice, losing critical nuance.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Single-winner elections ignore secondary preferences.</li>
    <li>Binary polls fail to reveal trade-offs or thematic linkages.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Core Idea of SBV</h2>
  <p>Each participant receives a budget of voting credits to allocate across multiple tags. The cost of votes on each tag grows quadratically, enforcing meaningful distribution.</p>
  <p>\( \text{Total Cost} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} v_i^2 \)</p>
  <ul>
    <li>\( v_i \): Number of votes allocated to tag \( i \).</li>
    <li>Budget constraint ensures balanced, thoughtful preference signals.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Example: Allocation of Credits</h2>
  <p>Given a budget \( B = 100 \), a voter might allocate:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Tag #Economy: 7 votes \(\rightarrow 7^2 = 49\) cost</li>
    <li>Tag #GreenSpaces: 5 votes \(\rightarrow 5^2 = 25\) cost</li>
    <li>Tag #AirQuality: 4 votes \(\rightarrow 4^2 = 16\) cost</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Total: \(49 + 25 + 16 = 90 \leq 100\)</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Semantic Graph Construction</h2>
  <p>Votes form weighted links between issues. Co-preferences create edges, revealing thematic clusters and relationships:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Nodes: Tags (e.g., #Economy, #Housing, #Healthcare)</li>
    <li>Edges: Weighted by co-preference frequency and intensity</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Integrating Qualitative Feedback</h2>
  <p>Participants can explain why they voted. These narratives add semantic context to the graph:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Keywords extracted from explanations enrich the relationships between tags.</li>
    <li>Sentiment analysis identifies enthusiasm, concern, or frustration.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>SBV for Curation Exercises</h2>
  <p>SBV helps communities collaboratively curate collections of items—be it content, art, research, or proposals—based on nuanced group preferences.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Curators distribute votes to highlight valuable items within a broad set.</li>
    <li>Quadratic costs ensure no single piece dominates solely due to vocal supporters.</li>
    <li>The resulting semantic map reveals which themes or attributes drive community interest in the curated set.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>SBV for Preference Signalling</h2>
  <p>SBV makes it easier to signal not just top priorities, but the landscape of one’s values:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Participants can indicate strong support for multiple topics without “wasting” votes.</li>
    <li>Quadratic costs ensure that signalling a broad set of interests is both possible and meaningful.</li>
    <li>Decision-makers see a spectrum of preference intensity, not just binary support or opposition.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Benefits for Decision-Makers</h2>
  <p>By examining the semantic graph, policymakers see more than just top issues.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Identify clusters of related priorities (e.g., #GreenSpaces connected to #AirQuality and #MentalHealth).</li>
    <li>Spot bridging topics like #PublicTransport linking economic growth and environmental sustainability.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Emergent Consensus and Insights</h2>
  <p>SBV surfaces natural points of alignment within a community.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Uncover hidden common ground, even among diverse stakeholders.</li>
    <li>Inform policies that address multiple concerns simultaneously.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Applications of SBV</h2>
  <p>SBV can transform governance, organizational strategy, and civic engagement:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>City planning: Understand priorities in environmental, economic, and cultural policies.</li>
    <li>Corporate strategy: Align shareholder preferences with strategic goals.</li>
    <li>Decentralized governance (DAOs): Achieve nuanced consensus in fluid digital communities.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Conclusion: A New Era of Deliberation</h2>
  <p>Semantic Ballot Voting blends quantitative rigor and qualitative depth to guide more informed, holistic decision-making.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Captures complexity beyond yes/no or single-winner outcomes.</li>
    <li>Empowers communities to map their collective will more transparently.</li>
  </ul>
